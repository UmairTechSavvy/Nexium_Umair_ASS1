Project Title: Quote Generator
Project Overview
This project is a web-based quote generator built using Next.js. It allows users to generate random quotes, which are fetched from an external API. Each quote includes both the quote text and the name of the author. The goal of the project is to provide users with short bursts of inspiration or reflection through a clean and responsive interface.

How It Works
When the user opens the website, they see a clean interface with a button to generate a quote. Upon clicking the button, a request is sent to an external quote API. The server fetches the data and returns a new quote along with the author's name. This information is then displayed on the screen.

The app uses ShadCN components for styling. This helps maintain a consistent and modern look throughout the interface. The design is kept minimal so that the focus stays on the quote itself.

Technologies Used
Next.js – for both frontend and backend logic

ShadCN (with Tailwind CSS) – for UI components and styling

Axios – to call the external quote API

API endpoint – to retrieve one quote at a time from a quote service

Key Features
A simple interface that focuses on the quote and author

Button to generate a new quote on demand

Real-time quote fetching from a reliable external API

Clean design using ShadCN components

Purpose
This project is designed as a small but practical example of how to build a full-stack application using Next.js. It demonstrates how to connect the frontend with a backend API, handle real-time data fetching, and build a modern user interface using a UI component library.
